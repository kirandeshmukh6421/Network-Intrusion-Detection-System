# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
A network intrusion detection system (NIDS) monitors both inbound and outbound traffic on the network, as well as data traversing between systems within the network. The network IDS monitors network traffic and triggers alerts when suspicious activity or known threats are detected, so IT personnel can examine more closely and take the appropriate steps to block or stop an attack.

## Implementation
● The network includes WIFI compatible devices which are monitored 
periodically for intrusions.
● These devices are connected to a router.
● Each device runs a packet sniffing tool called CICFlowMeter which 
monitors inbound and outbound network packets.
● The logs generated by this packet sniffer is forwarded to an 
Intrusion Detection System running on the cloud.
● Intrusion Detection System makes use of a dataset called CICIDS 2017
that contains live packet captures of attacks such as brute force, 
heart bleed, botnet, DoS, 
DDoS, web attack, and infiltration attack.
● This dataset is used to train the Machine Learning model that uses 
Decision Tree Classification Algorithm which predicts if there is an intrusion
in the network.
● On the occurrence of an intrusion, the network admin will be alerted via
E-mail.
